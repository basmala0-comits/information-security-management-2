üîπ Overview
This project is a secure RESTful API built using Node.js, Express.js, SQLite, and Sequelize ORM. It provides user authentication (signup/login with JWT) and product management features while implementing security best practices to prevent attacks like SQL Injection, XSS, and brute force attacks.

üîπ Features
User Authentication (JWT-based)
User signup with email & hashed password.
User login with JWT token authentication.
Protected routes using authentication middleware.
Product Management : 
Create, read, update, and delete products.
Products stored in an SQLite database using Sequelize ORM.
Security Measures : 
Password hashing using bcryptjs.
JWT token authentication for secure access.
Input validation to prevent SQL Injection & XSS attacks.
Database Integration :
Uses SQLite as the database.
Sequelize ORM manages models & relationships.
RESTful API Endpoints :
POST /register ‚Äì Create a new user.
POST /login ‚Äì Authenticate user & return JWT token.
GET /products ‚Äì Retrieve all products (protected).
POST /products ‚Äì Add a new product (protected).
PUT /products/:id ‚Äì Update product (protected).
DELETE /products/:id ‚Äì Delete product (protected).

Technologies Used
